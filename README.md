# Project: My portfolio
This project was about following a design example to create my own portfolio. The structure, fonts and proportions were set from start but I made my own choices with colours, hover effects etc. The webpage should also be accessible, i.e. it should be possible to read with screenreader, have good colour contrast and have semantiv html.

# Accessibility
I tested my page with WAVE (web accessibility evaluation tool) and Webaim contrast checker. I also used a validator from W3C Markup Validation Service and corrected the faults that appeared.
